# Introduction to EQ Works

Thank you so much for being interested in [EQ Works](https://www.eqworks.com). You can find some essential information about us, the company, technology, culture, and more in this repository.

## üìñ Culture Handbook

You can find our evolving culture handbook in our [Common project](https://github.com/EQWorks/common). In it, we introduce critical subjects such as:

- Our decision-making principles.
- **Our hiring philosophy and process**.
- Our asynchronous-first communication and collaboration practices.
- Our empowering flat and fluid organization structure.
- And more!

## üìç What do we do?

We build a platform of products and features and extend it to an ecosystem to help you understand and leverage geospatial data. You can find [an overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ymlJorsnuX_n6sDNbBdwu-r5_4ztr2BFI6vs3CT5Bog/present) of the products and technologies we build and use.

## üíª Work Samples

At EQ Works, we take a more effective path to the technical interview. Instead of solving abstract algorithms and data structure problems, you'll get to work on an open-book and open-ended work sample that resembles our actual work. If you are a maker, you may find the problems easier (perhaps more enjoyable) yet much more meaningful to understand how well you can integrate into our team from a technical perspective. We encourage you to check out our hiring philosophy in our [Common project](https://github.com/EQWorks/common) to get more insights.

## üôå Open Presence

We have a [LOCUS Engineering Blog](https://medium.com/locus-engineering) maintained by our product/engineering teams. In it, we share our thoughts on our product and technology, culture, and more.

You can find our growing portfolio of [open-source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/EQWorks?q=&type=public) in the spirit of contributing back to the open-source community through our humble efforts.
